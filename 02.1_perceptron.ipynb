We'll follow Amelia again in this example as she tries to dive into the inner workings of neurons and write her own code to implement a simple [perceptron](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#perceptron) to decide if she should go to a concert or not. As a note, this exercise lies somewhere between coding everything from scratch and relying on the pre-coded APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that underlie the power of TensorFlow, Keras, and Pytorch. You will not need to create weight tensors beyond this exercise, but hopefully by doing it this time, you will have a better understanding (and appreciation) of the details that are often lost in an API call to `model.fit()`, for exampe.\n",
